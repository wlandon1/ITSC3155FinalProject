    <h2>What is Wellness Together?</h2>
    <p style="width: 60%;">
        Wellness together is a resource created by students for students who suffer from mental struggles such as depression and anxiety. For
        this project, we had a vision to create something which would be able to benefit others. Our goal in creating this website was to
        create a resource that would be able to show people that they are not alone in whatever they struggle with. We believe that by making
        information about mental issues available to people, we can help to reduce the amount of isolation that comes with these issues.

            Born in Thailand in a refugee camp, mental illness was nothing too far from home. Many people who had mental illness were seen as
            crazy, haunted, or insane, and they never really got it treated medically. My family was similar in that aspect, as people would
            never really address mental illness and even at times the mental abuse was not addressed. Aside from personal relations to seeing
            the issue with the stigma around mental illness, the passion for this project came from wanting to help make resources, no matter
            which, more accessible to everyone around the world. I currently reside as a Sophomore undergraduate student at UNC Charlotte and
            plan to graduate Fall 2023.

            Hey, my name is William Landon and I'm an undergraduate student at UNC Charlotte. I'm studying Computer Science and I'll be graduating
            in Fall 2021. I grew up in North Carolina, about an hour outside of Charlotte. My passion for this project comes from a personal place.
            I have several friends that have struggled with mental health
            issues in the past, and I wanted to create a resource for people like them. I think that everyone can relate to having moments where
            everything just seems too overwhelming so I hope that this resource can give other people some hope.
