    <h2>Counseling Services for UNC Charlotte Students and Faculty</h2>
    <p style="width: 60%;">
        There are several available services for UNC Charlotte students and faculty. Most of these services are directed through
        an on-campus organization called CAPS.

    <h2>What is CAPS?</h2>
    <p style="width: 60%;">
        The Center for Counseling at Psychological Services (CAPS) is a department within the Division of Student Affairs
        at UNC Charlotte. CAPS, along with the Student Health Center, the Center for Wellness Promotion, and University
        Recreation, is a component of Health and Wellbeing, an administrative unit whose primary goal is to provide comprehensive
        wellness-related programs and services to UNC Charlotte students.<br><br>
        The UNC Charlotte Center for Counseling and Psychological Services provides individual, couples, and group counseling
        services, consultation, outreach, and psychiatric services to support UNC Charlotte students.<br><br>
        The services that CAPS offers to students are free of charge and there are an unlimited number of group sessions available
        for students to access. Although the number of one-on-one sessions is limited to a certain number per year, CAPS also
        offers recommendations for services outside of UNC Charlotte for students who may need them.
